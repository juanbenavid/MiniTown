-- Run with:
-- read_model -i CyberFalseFinite.smv ; go ; check_ltlspec -n #
-- where # is the ltlspec you want to verify
-- or 
-- read_model -i CyberFalseFinite.smv ; go ; pick_state ; simulate -v -k n
-- where n is number of states you wish to simulate
-- Should take a couple of minutes - but will run

-- Syntax notes:
-- := is assignment
-- = is equality
-- case blocks are equivalent to if/else statements
-- : defines a relation ( belonging to a type/set)
-- -> is implication

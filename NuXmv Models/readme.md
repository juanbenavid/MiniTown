# NuXmv Model Files
### 1. RealDemPattern.smv : real number equations, fixed demand sequence. This model is well commented, read first to understand nuxmv
### 2. RealDemAny.smv : real number equations, demand only constrained to change no more than 0.2 LPS between states
### 3. DiscreteDemPattern.smv : All discrete/finite precision variables, fixed demand sequence
### 4. DiscreteDemAny.smv : All discrete/finite vars, demand only constrained to change no more than 0.25 ( This model was having some problems, need to debug)
